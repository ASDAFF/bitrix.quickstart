	<ul>
		<li>Because the file is imported images. If the download of pictures going to an external link or image is superimposed architectural sign, it can greatly slow down imports. Try disabling images import and check the speed of the import.</li>
		<li>With a large volume of goods imported to the site speed drops sharply if the identification of goods or trade offers made on properties (eg on the article). In this case, we recommend to transfer the properties to identify in the \"External code\". If you use multiple property to identify, you can transfer them to an external code in this form \"[Property 1] _ [Property 2]\". When identifying external code imports take place much faster, because \"The external code\" element is contained in the table, while the properties are contained in a separate table.</li>
