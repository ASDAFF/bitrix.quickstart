<p>Our delivery charges include advance inspection at our warehouse and delivery by our professional delivery teams who will set your furniture in place and remove all packaging materials. You will be called in advance and notified of the estimated time of delivery, with a convenient 2 hour time window.</p>

<p>If it becomes necessary to reschedule your delivery, please inform the delivery department 48 hours in advance. Please ensure that we are informed of any product that you want removed (a charge applies) so that we can plan ahead.</p>

<p>Please have your home ready for the delivery. Remove any obstructions from the delivery path and the room or area where your purchase will be placed. For safety reasons, delivery personnel are unable to remove their shoes when entering your home. We do use carpet runners to protect your flooring during the process. In the winter months, please ensure both the driveway and walkways have been cleared.</p>

<h2>Shipping costs</h2>

<p>Shipping costs are calculated and displayed before you complete your order on the Online Store. You can also see shipping costs on the Order email and on online Order Status. If you order multiple items, you may receive separate shipments. You will receive a Shipment Notification email for each shipment with the carrier's name and tracking information, if available. Shipping fees for the entire order will be charged when your first item is shipped.</p>
