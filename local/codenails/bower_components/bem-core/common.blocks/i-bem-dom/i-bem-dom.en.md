# i-bem-dom

A helper block for creating other blocks that have a DOM representation.

The block is implemented as a specialized JavaScript framework for web development using the BEM methodology.

There is a separate document with a detailed [user's guide](https://en.bem.info/technology/i-bem/v4/i-bem-js/).
