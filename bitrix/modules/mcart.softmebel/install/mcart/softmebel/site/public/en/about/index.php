<p>About 15 years ago the Furniture Company was a small town producer and retailer in Braseltown. Today, we are the largest furniture showroom in the region.</p>

<p>Furniture Company was founded in 1993 under the idea of designing & manufacturing low-cost, solid-wood furniture.</p>

<p>Our services include design, space planning, hire/lease, repairs and re-upholstery, disposal of second-hand furniture, storage and filing solutions, as well as a selection from the widest range of office furniture to meet all designs and budgets.</p>

<p>Our ethos is based entirely on customer service and we listen closely to our client's criteria in all aspects of design, budget and timescale fulfilling them in every way possible.</p>
 
<p>Purchasing furniture is a very important decision for everyone. Please take your time. </p>
